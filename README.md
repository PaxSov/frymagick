# Frymagick

A project I am making to learn bash and imagemagick
In the future I will probably add things such as saturation and noise.
Feel free to contribute and fork this project.
I put this under an MIT license to avoid anything.
dependencys:
bash
imagemagick

Have fun!

## Possible updates:

* Options via command line, not via an interface
* Cleaner code
* Full deep frying of image, not just jpg
* Graphicsmagick version, imagemagick does not handle large amount of jpg'ing very well
* Windows port (python version???)

# CURRENT VERSION DOES NOT WORK
this project is being rebuilt. The current version on this branch is bad

May redothis when I learn getopt | For now just use this to learn from or something
